# Design Patterns – Software Engineering Course

This repository contains implementations of various **Design Patterns** studied during the *Software Engineering* course at university. The goal is to provide clean and concise examples for each pattern, organized by category.

## 📦 Creational Patterns
These patterns provide mechanisms for object creation that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

- **Singleton**
- **Factory Method**
- **Abstract Factory**
- **Prototype**
- **Object Pool**

## 🧱 Structural Patterns
Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping the system flexible and efficient.

- **Adapter**
- **Facade**
- **Bridge**
- **Composite**
- **Decorator**

## ⚙️ Behavioral Patterns
These patterns are concerned with communication between objects and how responsibilities are assigned.

- **Observer** 
- **Command** 
- **Chain of Responsibility** 
- **State** 
- **Mediator**
